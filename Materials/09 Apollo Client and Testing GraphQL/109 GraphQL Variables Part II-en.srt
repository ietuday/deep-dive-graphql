1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,430
In this video it's going to be up to you to extract every operation in Post dot test dot J.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,330
S. out into the operations file.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,780
So we have the Post's query right here.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,200
No variables but it still needs to be extracted down below.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,090
We have my posts which needs to be extracted.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,290
We then have our a mutation update post which takes in dynamic values that needs to be extracted down

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,120
below that we have create post and then down below that we have delete post.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,210
So we have one two three four five different operations.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,850
I'd like you to take some time to pull all of those out.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,700
Anywhere where a dynamic value is used you want to set up the appropriate type.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,460
Similar to what we did in operations.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,990
J.S. for things like create user where we used create user input or for log again where we used log

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,490
in user input.

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,550
So take as much time as you need to knock this out using what we learned in the last video.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,450
And if you get stuck along the way just refer to the operations file and the user test file to see how

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,950
we did things over there.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,790
Because in the end of the day the process is identical.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,370
We're just working with a different set of queries and mutations.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,930
All right knock that out.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,330
Pause the video when you're done at test your work then come back and click play.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,410
How that go.

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,620
Let's go ahead and kick things off just working.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,050
Top to bottom through the files starting with get posts no variables required.

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,220
So we could remove this one completely and bring it over to our operations file.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,350
I'm just going to add that down below at the bottom of the list and then we'll take a moment to export

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,280
it as well.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,540
So right here get posts.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,510
Excellent.

29
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,130
Now from here we have to make sure that we still load the operation in since we are referencing a get

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,660
posts variable.

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,190
So I set up an import statement up above.

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,430
I'm going to import get posts from that file right here.

33
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:08,140
That would be daat forward slash you tills forward slash operations.

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,240
Excellent.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,110
Now we have get posts in place we can save the program and move on to the next one.

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,390
The next one is my posts.

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,610
This one also requires 0 variables so we can go ahead and cut that out.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
Bringing it over to the operations file.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,010
So right here I am going to adjust the indentation of get posts and then down below I will set up my

40
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,300
posts and for my posts all we have to do is export it.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,560
So right here my posts perfect.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Now that we have this in place we can go ahead and import it into the other file.

43
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,750
So right here we are still referencing my posts.

44
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,990
Let's go ahead an important

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,510
my posts.

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,550
Perfect.

47
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,060
Next on our list is the update post mutation.

48
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,530
Here we are going to want to support a variable especially for data.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:10,100
So if you forget exactly what something uses you can always go over to schema dot graph QOL up at the

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,850
very top.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,120
We have our update post mutation that is sitting right here.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,670
We have ID of the type ID and data of the type update post input.

53
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,860
So those are the two arguments that we would need to pass in both variables.

54
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,740
Let's go ahead and actually set that up to start.

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,670
I'm going to grab this operation in its entirety.

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,710
I am going to copy it to the clipboard and I'm going to bring it over to the operations file pasting

57
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,540
it in at the bottom of the list.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,630
Then we're going to go ahead and make some changes to it.

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,980
We need it to variable.

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,950
So we need ID of the type ID exactly like we had over in our schema definition right here.

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,580
And we also need data of the type update post input.

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,590
So comma space dollar sign data update post input.

63
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,810
Perfect From here we can go ahead and use both of those down below.

64
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,350
The idea is going to get its value from the ID variable and the same thing is true with data.

65
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,310
We'll remove that data object getting the value from data instead.

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,030
Now everything is defined over in this file we're all done.

67
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,870
We can export update post.

68
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,860
And now we can focus on adjusting the test case to actually use this operation.

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,470
The first step in that process is going to be in porting it up above let's grab that third one right

70
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,250
here update post and down below we're actually going to use it.

71
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,250
So the first thing I'm going to do is define the variables we want to pass in.

72
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,280
So Konst variables equals an object.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,710
We're going to have to I.D. and data.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,270
So our set up ID.

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,810
It's going to get its value from post one dot Post dot ID and I'll set up the second one.

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,640
We're going to have data which is an object and I'm going to define once again just published setting

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,130
an equal to false.

78
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,370
Perfect.

79
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,920
Now we can remove the operation down below entirely and the last thing you needed to do is make sure

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,460
those variables were actually used by passing them in right here variables setting up that property

81
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,150
to get its value from the variable with the same name.

82
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,500
Now that we have that in place we can save the file and continue down the list.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,640
Next up we have create post followed by finally delete.

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,300
Post create post is going to go through the same process.

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,850
The first thing I'm going to do is just grab this operation copy it to the clipboard and bring it over

86
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,190
to the operations file.

87
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:47,330
I'll adjust the indentation of update post paste in create post and adjust the indentation there as

88
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,910
well.

89
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,970
And we're going to focus on the variable.

90
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,730
We need to create or be defining it right here.

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,450
This one called data is going to be of the type and we can always refer to schema to figure out what

92
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,300
we had called it right here we have create post.

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,780
It was called create post input.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,730
So over here create post input.

95
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,930
Perfect.

96
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,410
Now that we have this in place we can use the data variable.

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,400
Down here.

98
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,970
Removing the object and referencing the variable instead and last up we export it right here exporting

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,220
create post.

100
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,430
Excellent.

101
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,450
Now once again over in post.

102
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,200
Test.

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,050
J S.

104
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,130
We can adjust the test case.

105
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,640
I'm going to create a variable's object and we only need one property on there we just need data.

106
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,260
Data is going to have title body and published and we can use the same values we have below.

107
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,100
So title a test post body.

108
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,260
We can leave that empty and published.

109
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,540
We can set that equal to true.

110
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,480
Excellent.

111
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,220
Now we can remove this operation entirely and we can actually import it from up above.

112
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,670
So up above we are going to grab the thing we just export and create.

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
Post.

114
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,450
There we go.

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,450
We now have 4 out of five tests converted before we save.

116
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,520
Let's just make sure variables gets passed through.

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,120
Now we can move on to that last test case.

118
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,540
So down below we have delete post.

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,790
This does indeed take a dynamic value and the type for that one is just that ID as seen over here.

120
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,860
It's nothing special as a built in scalar type.

121
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,730
So let's go ahead and start by grabbing that operation definition.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm going to copy it and bring it over to the operations File.

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,330
We're going to be setting up a single variable ID of the type ID and this variable is going to get used

124
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,750
down below right here where we define the idea of the post to remove.

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,800
Perfect.

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,180
Now we can export it and use it in the test case.

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,190
Exporting delete.

128
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,900
Post over inside of our posts.

129
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,770
Test suite.

130
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,770
We can import it up at the very top.

131
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,220
Delete.

132
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,070
Post.

133
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,800
And then finally we can use it.

134
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:11,750
So down below to wrap up this video we are going to set up the necessary variables Konst variables equals

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,670
an object.

136
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,590
We define one thing id the value for that comes from post to post dot ID.

137
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,960
Now we can remove the old delete post-operation.

138
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,420
We're going to be accessing the new one that's imported and we will indeed set up those variables.

139
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,580
And now we're done all of our operations from the post test suite.

140
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:40,010
Now live over in the operations file allowing the test cases to stay focused on what it is they care

141
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,030
about down below our test suite is indeed rerunning And what do we have.

142
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,590
We have 10 passing tests.

143
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,380
Now I know the testing section has been a little long there's a lot of new information to cover and

144
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,080
it's a very important step to the development process here.

145
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,210
We were able to verify that a good deal of our application works in just 10 seconds.

146
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,540
I can go ahead and a and then rerun the entire test suite before I'm even done finishing this sentence.

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,650
That's going to allow us to verify our application is working as we build it out we'll be able to catch

148
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,410
problems as soon as they come up.

149
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,030
All right that's it for this one.

150
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,790
There are just a few videos left in this section.

151
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,090
We're going to talk about comments and testing subscriptions.

152
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,740
I'm excited to get to all of that.
