1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,570
You now know how to use Appollo client to fire off subscriptions queries and mutations and you also

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,070
know how to use geste to test your graph.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,490
Well code now there are more test cases we could write based off of what we already know.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,460
For example I can make sure that I can create a new comment when I'm authenticated and that I can't

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,310
create a new comment when I'm not authenticated.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,160
Doing that would use techniques we're already familiar with and we've already gotten practice with instead

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,630
of creating 10 more videos to cover these test cases.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm going to create just this one and provide you with a list of additional tests you could write to

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,990
get more experience based off of what you already know.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,620
You can find this list by heading over to the browser and going to links dummied dot I O forward slash

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,290
test ideas and all of the tests listed here are things you can already create using what you already

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:55,870
know.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,740
There's no test here you can't write with the information covered in this section.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,800
I have a little section for user post and comment related test cases.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,080
Let's quickly go through the list and then we'll be done.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,510
If for user we have some pretty basic ones should not sign up a user with an email that's already in

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,170
use.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
So we want to sign up as a user using the same e-mail as a test database user.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,650
It should fail.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
We're going to expect it to throw an error then it should log in and provide authentication token.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,360
In this case we will use the loggin mutation with valid credentials one of our test database users and

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,070
we'll ensure that it goes well.

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,520
It doesn't throw an error then we should reject me query without authentication and should hide emails

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,380
when fetching the list of users.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,880
Remember that email field is hidden from the public eye.

26
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,760
Down below we have post should not be able to update another users post along with it should not be

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,820
able to delete another user's post.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,360
From there we have it should require authentication to create a post and this could be a test case for

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,020
updating and deleting as well checking that those require authentication to Dambulla that should fetch

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,280
published post by ID.

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,900
So I should be able to fetch a published post even if I'm not authenticated.

32
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,080
Then it should fetch.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,700
Own post by ID.

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,190
So if I am authenticated I should be able to fetch something like a draft post that I own and last up.

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,550
Another idea should not fetch draft post from another user.

36
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,990
Dambulla we have comment.

37
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,750
It should fetch.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,690
Post comments should create a new comment.

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,460
Should not create a comment on a draft post.

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,870
Should update comment should not update another user's comment.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,240
Should not delete another user's comment.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,170
And finally you could add three test cases making sure that authentication is required when adding updating

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,790
and deleting a comment.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,000
So you already know what you need in order to get all of this done.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,490
It was all covered in the section and this is more optional than anything if you want a bit more experience

46
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,770
writing tests.

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,800
This is a great list to get started with.

48
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,040
All right that is it for this one.

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,420
Let's go ahead and jump into the next one.
