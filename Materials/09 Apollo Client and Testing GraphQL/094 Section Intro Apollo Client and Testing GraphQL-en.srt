1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,140
Welcome to Section 9 in this section you're finally going to learn how to interact with your graphics

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,160
API from outside of just graphical playground.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,920
That's going to allow us to do a couple of very exciting things.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,630
Number one you're going to learn how to interact with your application from the browser.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,650
So we'll see what it takes to do something like fetch a list of posts and render those to the screen.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,970
That's going to allow you to build out a front end for your graph QOL applications.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,480
The other exciting thing we're going to talk about is setting up an automatic test suite.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,500
So you're going to learn how to write test cases for your graphic app that verify it's always working

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,640
as expected.

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,430
This is going to prevent bugs from getting into production and messing with real user data.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,910
I'm excited to get to all of this.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,260
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the very first video.
