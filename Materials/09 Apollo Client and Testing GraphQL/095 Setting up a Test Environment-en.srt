1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,710
It's time to start setting up our automated test suite for our graphical application.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,030
Now in this video in particular we're going to focus on creating a third environment so we have a development

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,750
environment.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,090
We have a production environment and if we're going to be setting up an automated test suite we also

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,670
want a test environment in place.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,650
Now if you're wondering why we need a test environment and a separate place in the database for our

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,500
test data it's because our test suite this automatic process that we're going to set up it's going to

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,060
be interacting with the database quite a bit.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,360
We're going to be setting up dummy test data so that the code we run can actually get data back and

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,230
we can assert that everything is working correctly.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,950
This is going to happen over and over again and we're going to be manipulating the database a whole

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,550
bunch.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,560
So it's best to not interfere with our production or our development data.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,470
Now the good news is that deploying is going to be a super simple process.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,690
We're going to make a new environment very similar to the dev environment.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,270
So let's go ahead and kick things off by creating a new file in the config directory called Test dot

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,580
NVI.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,630
Now to start we can actually just grab the contents of dev Dom Ian V.

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,730
So I'm going to copy these three lines to the clipboard.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,290
I'm going to bring them over to the test environment file.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,240
And the only line we're going to change is the Prisma endpoint.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,120
Now if you remember from much earlier in the class there's actually two things that the Prisma endpoint

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,990
specifies.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,060
Aside from the actual You Arel the service end of the stage and by default both are default.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,030
That's why we see default dollar sign default in our development database.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:49,440
This is the default service and the default stage what we're going to do is override those values.

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,220
So for Devcon EMV as an example I could set up a forward slash default for the service name then forward

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
slash default for the stage name.

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,660
And this would be exactly the same as the code we have right here.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,060
These are identical because default is the default over intestate envy.

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm going to use forward slash default.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,590
So we'll stick with the default service name.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,190
But then for the stage name I'll switch that up.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,450
Calling it something like Test.

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,770
So now we have two separate places in the database.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,930
One for development data and one for test data.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,470
And this is a good thing.

38
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,940
Now that's the only change we actually need to make it to the test NVI file.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,620
From here we're actually ready to deploy our test environment to Prisma.

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,850
So from the terminal Let's go ahead and use the CD command to navigate into the Prisma directory.

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,580
And from here we're going to use Prisma deploy.

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,570
That's going to be Prisma the deploy we are going to provide the e argument so we can provide the path

43
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,710
to the configuration file we want to use which is this one.

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,020
So that would be a dot dot to get out of the Prisma folder.

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Forward slash config to go into that directory then forward slash.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,430
Test dot envie.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Excellent.

48
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,370
Let's go ahead and actually round this to deploy the test environment.

49
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,020
As always it's going to go through the process of communicating to our Prisma server.

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,260
Right here we can see all of the stuff it did and sense it is a brand new stage.

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,260
We can see that it created everything that's necessary and down at the bottom.

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,520
Everything went well it successfully applied those changes.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,870
And over inside of PGE admin.

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,590
If I right click the schemas list and click refresh.

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,680
We now have a new one.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,330
We had default dollar sign test.

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,660
This is where we're going to have all of our test data.

58
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,240
That data is going to be manipulated automatically via code and that code is something we're going to

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,410
work on creating next in the next video will configure that tool will be using for our test suite.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,590
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
