Welcome to Section 7 in this section which is a relatively short section there are two key things we

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,700
want to focus on setting up.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,670
We're going to set up the ability to sort our data and the ability to paginate our data.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,990
So imagine we are creating a client for our.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,500
Q An app whether it's a web client or a mobile client.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,240
We're likely going to show a list of posts on the home page and we want them to be in a particular order

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,180
likely with the most recently published up top then getting older as you scroll down the list.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,910
We can't do that unless we can sort our data.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,450
So we're going to set that up.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,870
Now we're also going to set up pagination.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,470
So imagine we do show the posts in the correct order with the most recent up top but we have 15000 posts

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,540
in the database from a number of users over a dozen years.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,940
We can't fetch and render all 15000 at the same time as we would likely cause major slowdowns on the

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,780
device.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,200
So instead we would paginate I would fetch maybe the first 15 or the first 50 then if the user gets

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,970
to the bottom we could load in the next 15 or the next 50.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,500
So we're going to set up both of those and we'll start with pagination.

18
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,680
Let's go ahead and jump right in.
