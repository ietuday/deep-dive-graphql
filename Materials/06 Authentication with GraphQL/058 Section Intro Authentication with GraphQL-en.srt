Welcome to Section 6 in this section we're going to focus on authentication.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,150
So right now our database exists but it's wide open anyone can come through and read any record they

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,290
want and they can manipulate them too.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,760
They could just come through and delete everything.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,560
Obviously that's not what we want.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,940
So in this section we're going to start by setting up authentication then we're going to focus on putting

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,520
some of our data behind authentication.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,680
So there'll be some stuff you could still access if you're not authenticated like published posts but

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,940
pretty much everything else is going to require authentication.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,680
If you want to access your drafts or if you want to do something like manipulate a comment or a post

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,810
you're going to have to authenticate so we can confirm you actually have the ability to do that.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,180
For example I shouldn't be able to edit a post that you create.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,300
All right let's go ahead and dive into the section and figure out how we can set up authentication.
