1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,220
You've made it to the end of the class you now know how to use graph Q Well and at this point you're

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,500
probably wondering where do I go from here.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,990
Now for most of my classes I'll answer that question over and over again in the course Q&amp;A.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,070
So this time around I figured I'd make this video giving my official recommendation of what to learn

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,260
next.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,490
The fact that you made it to the end of the class suggests you're already pretty familiar with the back

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,990
end if you were before.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,750
You definitely are now.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,820
So my recommendation for you is to take some time to explore the front end to learn how to build web

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,900
applications in the browser.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,290
Now not everyone is going to want to switch careers or do this for a living but it's definitely something

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,290
that's worth while to learn even if your primary focus is still back and development.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,260
It's going to give you everything you need to build full stack applications.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
So Down below I have two suggestions.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,730
As always you can find all of my courses at the following you RL.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,790
First up I have the modern javascript boot camp.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,550
This is where I cover the fundamentals of javascript which you already know but it's also where I cover

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,180
how to use the Nela javascript in the browser which you may or may not be familiar with.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,550
Next up my real recommendation is the complete re-act web developer course if you already familiar with

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,430
the fundamentals of javascript in the browser.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,500
This is the class that is going to take you to the next level you'll be using react to build real world

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,700
production ready web applications with all of the features you'd expect.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,390
Things like authentication data validation and more.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,040
So you can always find out more by clicking over to that class.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,450
Check out the promo video and as always the first several videos are available for you to watch for

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,000
free before joining.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,450
And as you're working through the course you're going to end up building a couple of applications.

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,170
The first one is a little app called indecision.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,030
This is how we're going to start exploring re-act you enter some options in.

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,530
I'll enter a new one like take a re-act course you can remove or remove ALL.

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,110
Here I can just have the computer pick for me and it says take a javascript course.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,400
So this is our beginner application and once we're comfortable with the fundamentals of react we'll

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,320
move on to our budget app where we're going to add a whole bunch more features.

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,430
You'll learn how to build out web apps that sort by date we'll be able to sort our data in the correct

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,880
order and search for expenses as well as add new ones.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,750
I'll add something in.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,080
Like my gas bill which I believe was about 30 bucks I can even pick the day I paid it and I can enter

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,970
a note if I wanted to.

39
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,460
So if this looks like what you're interested in learning I definitely recommend checking out the complete

40
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,490
re-act web developer course.

41
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,490
That's going to give you everything you need to build front ends for your back end.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,820
No.

43
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,350
J.S. apps.

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,980
All right.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,020
That is it for me.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,830
And that is it for the class.

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,930
I hope to see you in another class sometime soon.
