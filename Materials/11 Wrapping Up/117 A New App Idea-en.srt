00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,060
In this video as promised I'm going to go over a few ideas of features you could add to the blogging

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,080
application as well as another app you can build.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:17,640
You can find all of this over at Lincs dot Meade dot I O forward slash graph Q Well ideas that's going

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,080
to redirect you over to a text document.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,450
And here I have everything we're going to talk about in this video to start.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,070
Let's talk about new features you can add to the blogging application.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,550
This would be a great first step to take now that the class is over.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,660
It's going to require you to use everything you've learned in the course and there are three feature

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,210
ideas I had in mind.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,700
First up I should be able to delete other users comments if the comment is on my post.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,790
So if I write a post about a fun hike I just went on and someone else comes in and starts to call people

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,850
names or says something offensive I should be able to delete that comment from my post.

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,250
Currently that's not possible.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,630
The goal of the feature is to support that.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,030
So in the end of the day you could delete your own comment on any post out there.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,140
Or you could delete someone else's comment assuming it's on a post you've created so idea too.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,330
I should be able to disable comments on my post.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,590
Maybe you're writing a post and you don't want to deal with the outside world that you do want to publish.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,710
Being able to disable comments would be a great step for that you could add something like comments

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,740
and enabled as a boolean field on the individual post.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,840
That's something that someone could then configure when they create or update the post.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,280
The third idea I should be able to have a pinned or featured post I want to share.

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,590
This could be set up as a featured post property on the user type.

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,030
In this case it would be the type post so it would be optional.

25
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,250
I don't have to have a featured or pinned post but I should be able to.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,520
This could then be used somewhere like my author profile page to render the pinned content first.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,000
So these are just three ideas of what you could add to the application.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,270
Obviously there are plenty of other ones as well.

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,490
If you come up with anything else or if you implement any of these three go ahead and share them in

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,440
the Q&amp;A for this lesson.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,210
I would love to see what you built.

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,570
Whether you added one of these features or came up with something on your own.

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,110
All right now let's talk about the new app idea.

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,430
You can build it it's going to be something we discussed a bit earlier in the class.

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,400
If you remember from when we first explored Prisma you created a little product review Prisma instance

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,610
but we never built the no JSA side of things.

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,960
So that's the goal here.

38
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,000
A product review website where we have users products and reviews.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Users can create products and users can leave reviews on products.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,860
Now the product could be anything it doesn't have to be something you could buy.

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,520
It could be a review website for trails in the area or books or cities or companies to work at for a

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,130
trail as an example.

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,740
On the trail type you might have the name the distance and the location and for reviews along side of

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,650
the text they could provide something.

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,790
Maybe how difficult the trail was on a scale of 1 to 10.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,470
For books you can have things like the title the author and the ISBN number on the book and the review

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,020
could just be a generic text only review for city you could have something like the name of the city.

48
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,010
Maybe a walkability score can be part of the reviews along with whether they live in the city or are

49
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,530
just visiting as that would affect how you wait the review.

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,930
And for a company you could have the name and the location.

51
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,670
Maybe even though you R-AL as part of the company type and further review you could have them include

52
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,190
maybe their salary and their job title along with a standard text description.

53
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,460
So those are just a couple of ideas of things you could review.

54
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,680
Obviously the list goes on and on.

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,390
For the product you would add custom fields based off of what you're reviewing and the same is true

56
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,340
with the review.

57
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,290
Just as a reminder trail had things like the location and the trail review had things like the difficulty

58
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,100
score.

59
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,290
So this would be another great thing to build with what you've learned in the class and you can use

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,960
the boiler plate project we created in the last section to get this done.

61
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,560
As always if you end up building this or building anything else with graphite you will.

62
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,170
I would love to see that once again just post it in the Q&amp;A and share what you've done whether you shared

63
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,050
just the code or maybe a live example of your app.

64
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,290
I'd love to see it.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
All right that is it for this one.

66
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,200
Those are just a couple of ideas of things you can now build with the skills you have and at this point

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,730
it's definitely important to build something.

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,180
Maybe you'll use graft well in a professional setting in a few months or a year or maybe you're working

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,570
on switching jobs right now but it's still going to be a great idea to get some at home practice under

70
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,270
your belt.

71
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,600
That's going to make sure you remember how to solve problems and how to build applications using graft

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,190
Well that's it for now.

73
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,600
I'll see you in the next one.
