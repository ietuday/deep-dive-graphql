00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,530
Our time together is unfortunately coming to a close but we still have this one last section and there

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,920
are two important things I want to cover in the next video.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,780
I'm going to give you some suggestions for what you can now build with what you've learned in the class.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,070
So we're going to talk about some new features you could add to the blogging app and we'll also talk

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,200
about a brand new app.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,250
You can build from the ground up and that would be a great way to get more practice and really solidify

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,180
what you learned in the class in the second video in this section.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,550
I'm going to talk about where to go from here.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,450
The class is over.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,130
You've learned a graphic Well where should you go next on your learning journey.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,780
I'm excited to get to both of these.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,290
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
