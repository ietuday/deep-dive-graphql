00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,490
Welcome to Section 8 in this section the goal is to get your application deployed live to production.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,990
So right now everything is running locally on your machine.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,910
And by everything I mean your Prisma instance which is running in a local Dakar container and your.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,430
Yes app which is just running through node.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,100
The goal is to get both of those up and running on a production server that's accessible to the outside

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,790
world.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,280
That's going to allow someone who's not in our local network to actually access the app that's going

00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,950
to be important if we want others to be able to interact with the API or if we want to build out our

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,380
own mobile or web clients.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,530
All right let's go ahead and see what it takes to deploy graphs.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:43,950
Well.
