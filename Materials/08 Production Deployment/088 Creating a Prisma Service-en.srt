1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,610
It the goal of this section is to get a production ready version of our application deployed live to

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,320
the Web in this video.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,330
We're going to explore the tools we'll be using in order to get that done in the end of the day.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,570
There are three things we need to get done.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,770
One we need a production database so we need a place to host our production data too.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,880
We need a place to host our Prisma docker container.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,360
We're currently running docker locally but that's not going to work if we want people outside of our

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,030
local network to be able to access it.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,490
And third we need a place to host our node J.S. application.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,410
So those are our three needs.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,770
And we're going to fulfill those needs with two services.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,270
The first is Heroku Heroku is where we're going to host our database host our docker container and host

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,320
our node J.S. application the other service we're going to use Prisma cloud is going to make it really

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,870
easy to manage those Heroku Prisma instances.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,280
So we're not going to have to do anything fancy to get the database and the containers set up Prisma

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,800
cloud is going to handle that for us.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,680
And the good news is that we can get started for free with Heroku and for free with Prisma cloud.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,720
They have generous free tiers that don't expire after a month or a year.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
They just require you to pay if you want to collaborate with others.

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,920
So for our purposes we can deploy our applications to production for free.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,550
And that's exactly what we're going to end up doing.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,870
Now we already have a Heroku account we created that earlier in the course to get our database that

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,460
we've used throughout the class so far with Prisma.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,210
But we do need to explore Prisma cloud.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,980
So let's go ahead and pull that up.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,820
We can find it by heading over to Prisma dot.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,400
I know it's a product released by the official Prisma team.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,510
Now they currently have two products they have Prisma cloud the one we'll be using and Prisma enterprise

29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:04,230
targeted at larger corporations if we actually click on Prisma cloud we can learn more about the tool

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,110
and if we scroll all the way to the bottom of this page we can look at the pricing table.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,740
So for our purposes the free tier has everything we need.

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,370
We could collaborate with a couple of other people though if we want more than three we have to start

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,040
paying.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,600
We also get less metrics and lobbying and support but all of those are just nice to have.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,850
They're nonessential and we do get some Barebone ones which is great if you are moving into a application

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,740
where you have clients who are paying or you're building an app for someone else maybe the team plan

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,590
makes more sense and enterprise is a bit extreme for larger corporations.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,620
But once again for us free is just fine.

39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,510
It has everything we need to deploy our app securely to production.

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,110
So let's go ahead and actually create an account creating an account is free no credit card required.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,000
All we have to do is go through the sign up process.

42
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,620
I'll take a quick moment to log out so you can see what it's like.

43
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,700
You just got to sign up with your e-mail and password or you can connect to your get have account.

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,840
Either approach works just fine.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,500
In this case I am using my get how the account as my log in and once we log in we're going to be brought

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,620
to the Prisma cloud dashboard.

47
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,960
Now the first time you log in there's going to be a little survey asking you why exactly you're using

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,090
the service it's a new service so they're still trying to gauge what features are important and who

49
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,360
exactly is using it and for what purposes.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,130
Now on Prisma cloud there are three main pages we have services.

51
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,020
We have servers and we have settings settings is just a basic page for account management.

52
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,370
The ones that we're going to be focusing on are services and servers.

53
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,600
So with servers we are going to create a single Prisma instance so we're going to take that container

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,330
and we're going to deploy it to Heroku.

55
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,020
This is going to give us something similar to the server we have locally at localhost 4 4 6 6.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,890
So we're only ever going to create a single server.

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,980
Now under services we can have as many services as we want and we proved that earlier in this class

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,000
locally.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,690
Remember we created the Prisma folder which contained everything for our blogging application.

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:24,420
But as a challenge you also created the Prisma review Web site and we didn't create another doctor container

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,230
for that.

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:32,970
They were both using the exact same server and this worked because inside of our database under schemas

63
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,340
we have our data organized under default default.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,650
We have all of our data for our default service at the default stage and then down below we had the

65
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,000
reviews service at the default stage as well.

66
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,980
And that's where all that data lived.

67
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,210
So long story short we're going to have a single server and multiple services.

68
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,700
Let's go ahead and kick things off by actually creating a server.

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,730
Now if you click over the servers page you're going to have two things already there.

70
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,900
These are default servers managed by Prisma and you cannot manage or access them.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,790
So we're going to go ahead and create a brand new one.

72
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,950
We're going to add our own server and it's going to bring us through this little wizard where we pick

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,970
things like our server name our databases and our server size.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,690
So let's go ahead and stick with a nice specific name.

75
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,070
The name you're going to enter is globally shared.

76
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,690
So you don't want to use something generic like blogging application.

77
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,830
I'll typically use my name first.

78
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,190
You want to stick with just characters using hyphens to separate your words so I could use something

79
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,430
like.

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,950
Andrew Mead blogging app as an example that would be a pretty unique name.

81
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,900
Then down below just a quick description blogging application.

82
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,960
Awesome.

83
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,150
Now we can go ahead and click Create server we want to create a new one.

84
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,150
And first up we're going to create the database we're going to create a new database so make sure to

85
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,550
follow the same steps I'm following now and we create a new database.

86
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,710
It's going to ask us where we want to create that new database and currently Prisma cloud only integrates

87
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,490
with Heroku.

88
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,470
The other services are coming down the line so we're going to stick with Heroku which works really well

89
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,260
for us because we already have that set up.

90
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,390
Now when you click that it's going to bring you over to a list of all connected Heroku accounts you're

91
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,780
going to go ahead and connect an existing one that you have.

92
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,150
So click connect a new account.

93
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,350
This is going to redirect you to her Roku.

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,300
You'll have to click a button that says you allow Prisma cloud to manage your Heroku account then it'll

95
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,920
redirect you back to this site and the page you end up on will look a little bit like this.

96
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,720
It's going to ask for some details about the database you want to create.

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,430
Now we're going to stick with postgresql the only one supported and when it comes to your region you

98
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:02,100
can either pick us Virginia or EU Dublin just pick the one closest to you and your users down below

99
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,180
we have our database plan.

100
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,920
We are going to stick with the hobby dev plan which is completely free and doesn't require us to enter

101
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,430
any sort of credit card information.

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,990
You can always upgrade as users start to use your app down below we can actually create this database

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,150
and the process for creating the database just takes a couple of seconds.

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,230
It's communicating with Heroku getting that database set up for us.

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,310
And once the database is set up it's going to ask us to set up a server and that's what we're going

106
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,380
to do to wrap up this process.

107
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,000
We're going to click Set up a server and once again we can pick from different options.

108
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,820
We are going to use Heroku the only one currently supported even if there was other options supported

109
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,740
I would still be using Heroku.

110
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,560
It really is my preferred service because it's so easy to use flexible and customizable.

111
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,920
Right here we are sticking with that free plan once again as you have more users making requests to

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,620
your app.

113
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,660
Maybe it makes sense to upgrade.

114
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,540
I use the hobby plan for a lot of my client projects.

115
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,180
I honestly don't really need more than that for most applications down below.

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,650
We are going to create this server and this is where the wizard is going to stop.

117
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,490
Once the server is created we're all done.

118
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,660
Everything is set up and we can get back to looking at how Prisma cloud is going to help us.

119
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,100
Now the process of creating the server takes a bit longer than working with that database but once it

120
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,460
is done we're actually going to be able to see both the database and the server over on our Heroku account

121
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:39,490
and we'll even be able to connect it to our production database using PGE admin just like we were able

122
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,520
to connect to our other Heroku database.

123
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,000
All right.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,350
Everything is done.

125
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,120
And now we can view the server viewing the server just brings us over to the servers page.

126
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,830
So we might as well just click that and if we give things a refresh we should see a third item in the

127
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,520
list 3 to 1 and there it is.

128
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,670
Andrew Mead blogging app.

129
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,440
It's currently in the booting stage and if we click on that we can see that there is the server and

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,590
there is the database both hosted on Heroku.

131
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,870
So the server listed here that's going to take care of this requirement.

132
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,380
It's going to run our Prisma Dakar container and the database down below.

133
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,040
That's going to take care of this requirement that's going to be our production database where data

134
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,290
for our real users is stored.

135
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,220
Now we haven't done anything to deploy our code to that Prisma container that's running and that's OK.

136
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,780
We'll focus on doing that in the next video.

137
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,070
And we also haven't done anything with our node.

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,250
JS app and that's fine too.

139
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,150
We'll address that later in the section to wrap up this video.

140
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:52,680
The only thing I want to do is connect to our production database via PGE admin.

141
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,810
So what are we going to do to get that done.

142
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,730
Step one we're going to head over to PGE admin.

143
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,360
We are going to Right-Click servers list and we are going to create a server and then we have to provide

144
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,860
all of those connection details.

145
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,950
I can call this whatever I want.

146
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,380
I could say something like Heroku production database as an example.

147
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,300
And then on the connection page we have to fill out all of those connection details.

148
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,280
Where do we get them.

149
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,040
We get them from Heroku.

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,880
I'm going to go ahead and knock this out by heading over to the Prisma cloud page right here and clicking

151
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,730
view on Heroku for the database.

152
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,790
This is going to bring us over to that Heroku application and once we're here we can actually get into

153
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,790
the connection details by clicking Heroku post grass which has automatically been added for us.

154
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,970
If I click that it's going to bring us over to the database connection details like we saw earlier in

155
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,240
the class right here.

156
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,400
We can go over to settings we can go to View credentials and this is all the stuff we have to enter

157
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,910
inside of PGE admin.

158
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,110
So let's go ahead and get started.

159
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,820
The first thing we're going to do is grab that host.

160
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,140
I'm going to copy that.

161
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,680
Pasting it over into the host label.

162
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,970
Next up is our port.

163
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,860
The port should be the same value.

164
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,970
Five four three two is the default.

165
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm seeing that here as well after the port.

166
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,550
We have our maintenance database.

167
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,720
We're going to go ahead and toss in our database name right here.

168
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,430
I'm going to paste that in.

169
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:31,450
Then we have our user name so we have to copy the user name from Heroku and paste that in.

170
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,110
And the last thing we have is our password the password is really long it's sitting over here.

171
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,290
I'm going to copy it.

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,650
I'm going to bring it over to PGE admin and paste it in ticking that save password box so I don't have

173
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,970
to enter it over and over again.

174
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:53,950
Now if I actually save the connection we can see it showing up in the left hand side I'm going to go

175
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,180
ahead and close the other servers.

176
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Expand that one expand the databases and we should get a really long list of databases once again.

177
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,750
But one of those is ours.

178
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,430
Now to find it we can always just grab the first few characters here it's d three one.

179
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:21,270
Q For me I'm going to use command to search on page 3 1 Q And right here I can see my database.

180
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,610
It's gold which means I do have access to actually explore it and if I open it up cracking open the

181
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,290
schemas What do we see.

182
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,210
We don't see anything like default default or default Prod..

183
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,210
We haven't added any services.

184
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,170
We haven't deployed Prisma So this is completely expected.

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,130
As long as we're able to expand that database we are indeed successfully connected and that's where

186
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,260
we're going to stop for this video.

187
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,570
So let's take a quick moment to talk about exactly what we did in this video.

188
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,750
We signed up for Prisma cloud.

189
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,770
It's a service that makes it really easy to host your Prisma applications.

190
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,380
It makes it really easy because it directly integrates with cloud providers like Heroku and it manages

191
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,600
all of the setup for us so we don't have to in the end of the day it's going to give us all the tools

192
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,990
we need to deploy new versions and manage our various services.

193
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,040
It's important to note that Prisma cloud is not a requirement for hosting Prisma neither of these are

194
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,030
they're both optional.

195
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,040
There are a ton of other choices you could have made as well.

196
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,260
This is just my preferred stack for example.

197
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,230
The only thing you really need is a hosting service that supports containers.

198
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:40,270
Amazon Web Services does Heroku does other services like digital ocean do there are a ton of container

199
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,150
hosting services out there and you need a service that can give you a post gresse database.

200
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,410
That's also a dime a dozen There are hundreds of different services that allow you to set up a post

201
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,780
gresse database.

202
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,980
So in the end of the day these are just a couple of tools we can use to make the job easy.

203
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,680
They are by no means the only tools you can use to get this done.

204
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,480
All right.

205
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,700
That's it for this one.

206
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,610
We have the basic setup in place and the next video we're going to focus on making some changes to our

207
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,970
project so we can actually get one of our services deployed and then we'll be able to interact with

208
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,440
that database reading and writing from the production database.

209
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm excited to get to that.

210
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
