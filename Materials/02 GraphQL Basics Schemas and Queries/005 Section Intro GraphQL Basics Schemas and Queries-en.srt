00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,340
Welcome to Section 2 and this section we're really going to get started with the course.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,060
We'll start off by exploring exactly what Grath well is.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,020
For example what's a graph.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,850
Then we'll dive into actually using graphs well inside of a J s application.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,690
By the end you'll have a pretty good idea of what exactly graph you are does and how it does it.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm excited to get to it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,240
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the first video.
