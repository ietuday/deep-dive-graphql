00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,260
Welcome to section number 10 we spent this class creating our application from scratch.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,640
We built it up over time integrating new tools along the way.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,900
We started with graphical yoga.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,050
Then we introduced tools like Prisma Heroku jast Apollo and more.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,060
Now what if we're ready to start a second project what do we do.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,080
Do we create an empty folder and configure all of these again and getting them to play nice together.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,760
The answer is no we don't.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,920
We already did that.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,290
All of these tools are set up and configured in our blogging application.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,600
But we're going to do in this section is create a boilerplate version of that.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,850
So we're going to get all of the blogging specific stuff leaving you with a nice boilerplate project

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,280
you can use as a starting place in the future.

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,270
Then in the second video I'll show you how to actually use this.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,580
So we'll go through the process of cloning the boiler plate and getting it set up in development test

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,740
and production.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,850
I'm excited to get to this as it's going to give you a great way to get started with future projects.

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,460
Let's go ahead and jump right in.
