1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,210
In the last video together we updated our post subscription to support and he created updated and deleted

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,770
events in this video.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,840
You're going to be doing the exact same thing as a challenge but for the comment subscription and the

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,060
good news is that the comment type does not contain any sort of published property like we have with

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,150
our posts.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,840
So there's no strange conditional logic that needs to happen.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,070
Working with the comments subscription is going to be way more straightforward.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,840
All right let's talk about exactly what I'd like you to do over in mutation Dhananjay J s up at the

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,140
top.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,700
I am going to paste in the challenge comments for knocking this one out.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,290
Once again the big picture goal is to set up support for the created updated and deleted events on our

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,660
comment subscription.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,880
Now step one is to set up a custom payload.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,460
So currently we are just sending back the individual comment.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,310
We still want to send that data back but we also want to send back the string that represents what type

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,270
of mutation actually caused this event to fire.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,820
Was this comment that I'm getting back created updated or deleted.

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,910
So just like we did for the post subscription we want to send back a new custom payload by creating

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,310
a custom type with those two fields.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,190
That brings us to step two which is to update our one existing call related to the commet subscription

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,120
that is in create comment and we just want to change what we're sending back to support the new custom

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,510
type we're creating.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,700
So we have to add on that mutation property setting its value equal to create it then you're going to

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,090
do the exact same thing for actually deleting a comment.

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,980
Now in this case there is no existing published call for that.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,270
So you're going to have to add one in once the comment is deleted.

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,180
You want to call publish sending that event off.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,090
Now once again there is no conditional logic to worry about here.

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,150
Very straightforward.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,090
And the same thing is true with Step number four right here you are adding a publish call to update

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,290
comment to send out that updated event just passing along the actual mutation string and the data that

32
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,880
brings you to step five which is to test your work.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,090
You want to start up your subscription then you want to create a comment update a comment and delete

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,120
a comment to make sure you see all three events firing correctly.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,850
So take some time to knock that out and feel free to use whatever we talked about in the last video

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,790
since this and the last video we're going to follow a similar set of steps paused the video test your

37
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,140
work and when you're done come back and click play.

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,800
How'd you do.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,110
Let's go ahead and kick things off with Step number one.

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,840
Setting up our custom payload type for the comment subscription with data and mutation over in schema

41
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,610
damn graphs.

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,750
Well we're going to do just that by defining the new custom type near the bottom of the file right here.

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,890
A new type comment which is the subscription name followed by subscription payload

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,120
and we're going to set up the two fields we know we need one we do need the mutation that's the whole

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,980
point of doing this restructuring.

46
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,330
We went a little bit of context about why this event is firing and we still want the data.

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,180
So I still want to be able to get the comments right here.

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,330
Data is going to be of the type comment.

49
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,760
Now we can actually modify our subscription up above to use this type appear.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,250
We have our comment subscription which currently sends back a comment.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,220
I'm going to change that to sending back an instance of our comment subscription payload making that

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,940
a non nullable field.

53
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,870
Awesome.

54
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,580
This is actually the only thing necessary to change in schema doc graft.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,750
Well that's the end of step 1 and we can move on to Step 2 which happens in mutation at J S.

56
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,000
Here we are changing our existing published call uncreate comment.

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,990
So if you remember Krait comment lives near the bottom and we currently do have a publish call.

58
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,780
We're not going to change anything about the channel name.

59
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,640
What we need to change is the structure right here like we did in the last video.

60
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,880
So I'm going to empty this object out and break it out onto multiple lines.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,590
Now we're still going to have that comment route property but this time it is an object that matches

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,860
up with the custom type we just created.

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,320
So I need mom nutation field and I also need in my data field the value for mutation is going to be

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,370
the string created.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,460
So let's add that in right here and the value for data is going to be our comment which I have in the

66
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,680
comment variable.

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,430
Awesome.

68
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,400
So now step two is done.

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
And we should be correctly notified about newly created comments.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,720
Let's go ahead and move on to the next step.

71
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,070
Step three which is to change delete comment right now delete comment does not have a pub sub publish

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,820
call.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,740
So I am going to go ahead and restructure it and add one in.

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,390
I'm going to grab pub sub from the context object down below just like we did for our posts.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,330
I am going to structure this array grabbing the first item in creating an individual variable for it.

76
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,980
I'm going to call that one deleted comment and that's going to allow me to use deleted comment down

77
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,540
below.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,500
As opposed to needing to grab it off the array every single time I want to access it.

79
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,670
Awesome.

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,570
Now this was not a necessary step.

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,040
If you left things as they were in regards to what I just change that's fine too.

82
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,850
All that's important is that you added the pub sub Dom publish call into the mix right here.

83
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,380
We have to specify the correct channel name.

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,760
Remember it's comment space followed by the post ID so comment space and I can grab the post Id off

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,140
of deleted comment right here.

86
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,160
Deleted comment.

87
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,830
Post contains that data.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,700
And then we provide the second argument.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,500
Our object we set up that route comment property we set up our mutation value.

90
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,320
In this case we are deleting some data so I will set the value equal to deleted and then finally we

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,300
set up data passing in the deleted comments.

92
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,210
Excellent.

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,530
And that is it for Step number three.

94
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,170
Our delete comment mutation method is all set up.

95
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,830
That brings us to step number for the last method to change is update comment.

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,030
Once again we do need to structure pub subs since there is no existing publish call and sign of here.

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,180
Then down below we can use pub sub dot publish we are going to pass in that channel name.

98
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,760
So once again comment space followed by the comment post ID.

99
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,190
Now the post ID is available on comment.

100
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,120
Post.

101
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,570
Then we're going to set up the object.

102
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,910
We have our route comments property on there we have a mutation property and for this one we are going

103
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,730
to send back our little updated event.

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,070
And finally we have our data which comes from the comment variable.

105
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,090
So right here comment perfect that is done for Step 4 and that brings us to the final step which is

106
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,000
to actually test all of this out.

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,530
So I want to go through the process of creating updating and then deleting a comment making sure the

108
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,280
event fires correctly.

109
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm going to switch over to my comment subscription tab and before I can actually start this one up

110
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,970
I am going to need to change what I'm requesting since in this case Id text an author no longer exists

111
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,050
directly on here.

112
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,830
Instead what we have is mutation which I am going to grab.

113
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:13,270
And we also have data on data that's where we can grab things about the comment like it's ID the text

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
and some info about the author.

115
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,260
I'll grab the author's ID and the author's name.

116
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,580
Now if I refresh the schema this should become a valid operation.

117
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,070
Here it is indeed valid and the last thing I'm going to do is change this post ID to the idea of a post

118
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
that is actually published.

119
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm going to use either 10 or 12.

120
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,260
I'll stick with 10.

121
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,220
Now if I fire this off we should start the listening process down below it does say it's listening which

122
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,910
is great.

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,370
And now we can move into our other tabs and actually create update and delete a comment.

124
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm going to start by creating a comment using my Create comment mutation.

125
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,820
Now in this case it's the wrong post ID.

126
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm going to switch this over to making a comment on the post with an ID of 10.

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,450
Now if I fire this off the comment was indeed created and I should be able to see that event over in

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,830
my subscription tab.

129
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm going to click over to that and look for that new event to fire.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,590
Right here we can indeed see the created event where we have all of the correct data.

131
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,970
Now let's go ahead and actually grab this comment ID.

132
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm going to use this for my other tests.

133
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,650
Next up I am going to update a comment right here.

134
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,050
The comment has the idea of the ID I just copied.

135
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm going to change the text to something like this is my new comment text with a couple of exclamation

136
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,730
marks and if I send that off we can see the operation did appear to succeed and over inside of the comment

137
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,040
tab.

138
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,640
We should have our second event firing with a mutation value of updated and there we go.

139
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,490
We have our mutation values set correctly and we have our new comment text showing up last up.

140
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,190
What do we have.

141
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,680
Well we have our delete comment event right here we have.

142
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,810
Delete comment.

143
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,090
The mutation we're going to delete the comment we created.

144
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,170
I'm going to paste in that same ID.

145
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,150
The same idea used for updating the comment we're going to fire that off.

146
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,260
We do indeed get our deleted comment data back and if I head over to that subscription tab we should

147
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,860
have our third and final event showing up right here.

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,030
We have our deleted event.

149
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,550
As expected we can see the exact data and we can see the actual event.

150
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,310
Type the mutation type was indeed deleted.

151
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,390
So there we go.

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,630
We now have both of our subscriptions and they're actually useful for keeping the front end up to date.

153
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,930
If a front end client actually subscribed to the comments for a post it could render new comments when

154
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,880
they're created.

155
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,110
It could update existing ones when they're updated and it could delete comments from the rendered output

156
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,370
when a comment is marked as deleted.

157
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,700
That's where we're going to stop for this video.

158
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,720
The challenge is now over and our two subscriptions are working really really well.

159
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,950
There are still a couple of videos left for this section there are a few things that I still want to

160
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,680
take the time to talk about.

161
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm excited to get to those.

162
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,470
So let's go ahead and jump right into the next video and talk about the income's type.
