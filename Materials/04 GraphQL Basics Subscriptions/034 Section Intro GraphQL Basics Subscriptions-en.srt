Welcome to Section 4 and this section you're going to explore the subscription operation.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:14,300
So with queries we can fetch data with mutations we can change data with subscriptions as the name suggests

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,080
we can subscribe to data changes.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,280
So imagine I use a query to fetch something like a post I get the title and the body.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,430
But if those values change I don't get those changed values I would have to manually send off another

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,070
query to get the new information with a subscription.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,630
We can actually subscribe to data and get notified in real time when changes occur because subscriptions

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:46,310
use web sockets that allows for a bidirectional real time communication between the server and the client.

9
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,410
Now all of this is going to allow us to add real time features to our app so we could render comments

10
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,070
for a post as they come in.

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,610
We can show notifications if your favorite author publishes a new post or we could do anything else

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,220
that requires real time apps.

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,100
All right let's go ahead and jump right into the section and see how to use subscriptions.
