1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,870
In this video you're going to be setting up your aboon machine to work with Prisma.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,940
So there are a few dependencies we have to install before we can actually explore Prisma itself.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,560
If you're on Mac or Windows your installation videos were the past two videos.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,030
This one is only for my a boon to users so if you're still watching I am going to assume you are using

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,220
the aboon two operating system and we're going to kick things off by actually just sticking with my

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,140
Mac screen share.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,880
Then we'll switch over to aboon do in about three minutes.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,410
So let's go ahead and jump right in.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,210
The first thing I'd like to do is get us set up with a database and the database we're going to be using

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:47,410
is post-grads post-crash is an S Q L database and it pairs really well with graft Well Eskew all databases

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:53,320
in general pair really well with well because with graphs you well you have to be explicit about the

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,260
exact fields and type definitions for those fields making it an easy match later on in the course I

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,790
will show you how to set up Prisma with Mongo D-B if that's your cup of tea.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,790
Honestly any database you can pick works because in the end of the day Prisma abstracts that database

15
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,150
away anyways.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,840
For now though let's go ahead and grab a post gresse.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,260
Heading over to Heroku dot com.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,400
Now there are plenty of places where you can get a post gresse database and you do not have to use Heroku.

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,130
I use Heroku because they have a free tier for what we're about to do.

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,740
So you actually don't need to pay in order to get a basic database up and running for your sample application.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,860
So take a moment to log in if you have an account and sign up.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,290
If you don't I'm going to go ahead and log in to my existing account and once we're in we should see

23
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,560
a dashboard.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,280
Now if you're creating your new account it's likely going to send you through some new customer flow

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,900
or it asks you to create an app and that's good because that's exactly what we're going to do.

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,860
I'm going to create a new application and we're going to give it a name.

27
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,830
I'm going to start with my last name and all lower case letters.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,170
No there's no spaces allowed.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,720
So I will use hyphens to separate my words.

30
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,290
That is Mead hyphen Prisma hyphen dev server.

31
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,240
Awesome.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,840
Now we don't need to touch the region.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,730
You likely have a default region.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,910
Good for your location around the world.

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,750
You could customize it to Europe if you wanted to but since I am in the US I'll stick with that and

36
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,060
I'm not going to touch the pipeline at all.

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,320
All we're going to do is create the application.

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,560
And once the application is created it's going to bring us to a set of steps describing how we can start

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,930
to deploy things.

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,450
Now there are plenty of features for Heroku we're actually not going to need in this class.

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,220
We really only need a very small subset of them and we can get started by heading to the overview tab

42
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,860
for our application.

43
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,750
But we're concerned about is installing Add-Ons.

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,230
There's one for a post gresse database.

45
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,430
So let's head over to the configure add ons page and from here we can search all of the available add

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,990
ons you want to search for Heroku post graphs.

47
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,370
Now there is a free tier for that.

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,370
So once we click on Heroku post grass it's going to allow us to pick the option we want everything from

49
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,170
free to $12000 a month.

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,630
Let's go ahead and start with that free plan.

51
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,170
I am going to provision this which is going to create the database and once the database is created

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,570
We're going to be able to click that in our add ons list.

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,540
It's going to bring us over to the page where we can learn a little bit more about our database.

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,080
One important thing we need from here are the credentials.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,190
The credentials that allow us to connect to the database.

56
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,370
You can find those over in these settings tab.

57
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,870
Right here we have the database credentials area and we can view our credentials.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,520
And this is the information that we're going to need to connect to this newly created database from

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,130
the outside world.

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,000
There now are over on my REAL a Bundu machine and we're going to go through the setup process and the

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,490
next tool that we're going to be installing is PGE admin PGE admin is a post grass database.

62
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,160
So it's going to give us a graphic user interface to interact with our database.

63
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:11,770
We can create data update data delete data or read our data all from an excel like view.

64
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,560
Now this is a really great tool.

65
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,660
Obviously we are still going to connect to our database using code that's coming but the Guly is just

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,470
going to make it easier for us to track our data over time.

67
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:30,610
Now for aboon do what we're going to be installing is PGE admin NPG admin is the same tool we're installing

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,420
on Windows and Mac.

69
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,200
The only difference is that currently even the latest version of aboon do doesn't support the latest

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,090
version of PGE admin.

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,180
So to talk about this let's go ahead and crack open the Ubuntu installer.

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,540
Right here we are going to search for PGE admin.

73
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,000
We are looking for at PGE admin.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,280
Version 3 that's currently the only version available version 4 is out.

75
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,480
It's essentially the same thing.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,840
It just looks a little bit nicer So this tool is still going to work just great though.

77
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,470
So I'm going to go ahead and install this one.

78
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,080
I'll authenticate myself and it will start off that installation process.

79
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,590
Now once this tool is installed we're actually going to connect to our postgresql database using it.

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,030
Once we have that connection set up will be all done since the installation has completed.

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,100
I am going to launch the application in the background.

82
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:33,000
We now have PGE admin version 3 and we are going to connect to our server now by default.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,130
Over here we have NOS servers so we need to create a new one and we do that using this little guy right

84
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,790
here.

85
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,680
This allows us to add a connection and then we have to fill out the connection details step 1.

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,430
We can just pick some sort of name that makes sense.

87
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,180
You could use for example Heroku PGE anything would work.

88
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,150
Does it need to be specific to your credentials.

89
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,210
Next up we have our host and this is where we start to pull some database information from our credentials

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,690
page.

91
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,290
So right here I am going to grab that host value copy it to the clipboard bring it over to PGE admin

92
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,700
and paste it in.

93
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,570
Next up we have the port the default port for post gresse is 5 4 3 2 and the same thing is true over

94
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,510
here so there is no need to make any change.

95
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,640
Next up we have maintenance DB.

96
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,430
We are going to change that to be our database.

97
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,840
So right here I'm going to copy that database value.

98
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm going to paste it in as the value for maintenance DBI.

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,000
Then we're going to move on to the user name and the password.

100
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,980
Both also values we have over here.

101
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,850
So first up I have the user.

102
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,570
I'm going to copy that and paste it in and then after user I have the password I'm going to copy that

103
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,200
as well.

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,100
Pasting that in to the application.

105
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,030
So from here we have all of our information set up we don't have to worry about any of the other tabs

106
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,290
and we can now go ahead and actually create this connection.

107
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,780
It's going to warn us about saving passwords.

108
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,520
We do indeed want to save the password to prevent us from having to provide it every single time we

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,850
want to connect.

110
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,780
Now once we actually do get through that process under server groups we're going to have a single one.

111
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,440
We have our Heroku post gress server and we can go ahead and actually connect to it.

112
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,990
Which is exactly what I'm going to end up doing.

113
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,590
Now here we have a few different views.

114
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,820
What we're concerned with is the databases.

115
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,880
Now you'll notice that there is about 2000 2042 to be exact.

116
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,520
Different databases on this one server.

117
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,260
Now we can't access all of them.

118
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,350
We can only access the ones we've been given privileges to access So for example if I try to click any

119
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,590
random old database we're going to get an error.

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,620
Permission denied.

121
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,770
Which is a good thing.

122
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,040
Any database that has that little red X to it is not something that we're going to be able to access.

123
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,130
What we're going to do though is scroll down and find ours.

124
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,580
Our starts with D 6 3.

125
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,180
So let's go ahead and work our way through this list.

126
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:11,370
I have Diwan did two three four five D6 should be coming up real soon here and right here we have D6

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,860
and we have a single database.

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,650
Without that red mark next to it.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,040
This is the one we can actually connect to and if I click it and connect we can see the connection was

130
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,920
indeed successful and now I can expand that database and start taking a look at things like it's data.

131
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,280
Now currently there is nothing worth looking at inside of here because we haven't added any data to

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,580
the database but once we connect Prisma and start manipulating the data we'll be able to view it over

133
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,300
here.

134
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,490
So for now that's all we're going to do for PGE admin.

135
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,940
We installed the tool.

136
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:53,400
We connected it to our postgresql database that Heroku gave us and now it's time to move on to the second

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,310
thing we have to configure which is Daker.

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,580
We can learn a bit more about docker by heading over to the browser and going to dr.

139
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,080
Dot com if you've never used or worked with Daker before that's perfectly fine.

140
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,620
We're going to be using a very small amount of Dakar in this class.

141
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,470
DAKAR can be a complex tool in the whole dev ops space and there are literally entire To me courses

142
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,120
that just cover docker.

143
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,080
We don't need to worry about all of that.

144
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,600
We're using a very very small subset of its features.

145
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,410
Now what is Dakar.

146
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,600
Well it's part of this whole containerisation and virtual machine movement.

147
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,670
So if I'm building up an application I have my application code and I have my dependencies.

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
Let's say I need to run on Linux.

149
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,450
And I also need get a. node Yes and stop.

150
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,400
Now I have a couple of options I could choose to allow people who want to run the application to actually

151
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,010
install all of those things that I could cross my fingers and hope it works on their environment or

152
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,590
I can bundle it all up into a container.

153
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,860
The container which in essence is a little virtual machine can then be executed from anywhere docker

154
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,240
is supported and the good news is that docker is supported pretty much everywhere whether it's Mac Linux

155
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,330
or Windows.

156
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,560
You can run Daker containers regardless of what tools or dependencies they need.

157
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,350
You don't have to slow down and install a whole bunch of stuff on your machine.

158
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,910
For every application instead you just run the container.

159
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,320
It's very easy to stop containers to delete them and to free up all of that space without trying to

160
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,680
remember all of the dependencies you had to install.

161
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,050
It's just a better way to manage apps.

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,930
Now there are two sides to docker.

163
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,130
There is the person creating the application and creating the container and there's the person who's

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,480
using the container to run the application.

165
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,940
That's the side we're on.

166
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,810
So we're not going to learn about the ins and outs of docker because in reality we're just a user of

167
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,840
docker trying to run a container provided by somebody else.

168
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,850
Now we're here just to install it to install Dharker on aboon do we have to work through a very manual

169
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,650
process so long story short we're going to be running a bunch of commands from the terminal.

170
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,510
Now there are two articles we need in order to get the correct commands.

171
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,400
First up we are going to Google get darker.

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,550
E that stands for community edition for Ubuntu.

173
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,220
The community edition is the free edition that we can use to work with docker outside of an enterprise

174
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,370
environment.

175
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,770
Now the first one is the one we're looking for.

176
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,170
So make sure the u r l matches up.

177
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,440
This is what's going to allow us to install docker and there is just one more article that we're going

178
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,670
to work through as well.

179
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,470
I'm going to pull that up right here.

180
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,870
That one is called install a docker compose.

181
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,370
If we Google that the first result is the one we're looking for docs dot dot dot dot com forward slash

182
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,220
compose board slash install.

183
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,850
This is a nother utility that we're gonna need to actually take the Prisma application and get it deployed

184
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,930
which will work through in the coming up videos.

185
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,660
For now though we have to install these tools and we are going to work through this article.

186
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,580
Get Dankers CD for aboon do if you want to go on your own that's perfectly fine.

187
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,310
Long story short we're gonna be running every single command shown in this article so let's get to it.

188
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,770
The first one is going to uninstall potentially old versions of things we have on our machine.

189
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,470
Now you might not have anything that you remember but it's always a good idea to run it just in case.

190
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,600
Perfect.

191
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,920
And once that's done we are just going to move down the list so down below.

192
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,300
We can go ahead and install using these steps for Bundu 16 and newer.

193
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,570
I'm running on eighteen point in 0.4 so this is what I want and there are a bunch of commands down below.

194
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,240
First up we're going to make sure everything is up to date.

195
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,250
Using apt get update.

196
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,820
That might take a little while depending on how long you've gone between running it and once that's

197
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,420
complete We're going to move on.

198
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,970
To actually allow ourselves to install from.

199
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,560
H t t p s.

200
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,900
So here we're going to copy that command to.

201
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,340
We're going to fire that off.

202
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,450
And once that's done we'll be able to continue on down below.

203
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,690
We are going to configure ourselves with docker.

204
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:10,970
We had to run this command to get the official GOP key and after that what do we do.

205
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,490
Well we're going to go ahead and set up our fingerprint I'm going to grab that command I'm going to

206
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,290
run it.

207
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,540
Excellent.

208
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,260
Now after that we moved down below.

209
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,730
And here we are actually configuring ourselves with the repository for docker.

210
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,010
This is where we can grab the stuff that we're about to install.

211
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,010
So we're going to grab that command.

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,790
Run it from the terminal as always and wait for it to finish.

213
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,730
Once again a very straightforward process.

214
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,760
Now once this is done we're actually going to be able to install Thakurs community edition down below.

215
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,230
Installed Dockers see we can update one more time.

216
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,340
Once that's done we are going to run the installation command for Daker hyphen C E which is what we

217
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,040
want.

218
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,830
Let's go ahead and fire that off right here.

219
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,830
I'm going to fire that off.

220
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,700
And this could take a significant amount of time depending on your network speed and environment.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,900
Now after we have the docker community edition installed we can go ahead and choose to install a specific

222
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,480
version which we're not going to do.

223
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,250
We're just going to install the latest version that you could run a command to get that done.

224
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,350
So we can actually skip step three entirely and move on to Step Four.

225
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,810
Now this is their way of verifying that things are working correctly.

226
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,540
We could go ahead and do this though it's not necessary the way that we can verify is by running.

227
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,100
Dr hyphen hyphen version if this prince a valid version.

228
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,240
No we know we've installed things correctly.

229
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,630
If you get some output like command not bound then things didn't install correctly but don't worry you

230
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,790
can always open up a new question in the Q&amp;A and I'll work with you to get unstuck.

231
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,980
This installation method isn't ideal but it is all we have for our Linux based operating systems.

232
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,640
So thanks for bearing with me as we ran through all of those comments on Mac and Windows.

233
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
It's much easier.

234
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,310
Click next type installer.

235
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,920
But to each their own.

236
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,680
Now next up we have the second article which is much quicker.

237
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,860
We're going to install doc or compose which we need as well.

238
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,920
We can pick our path we are using Linux and all we have to do is run a couple of commands so right here

239
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,050
we are going to fetch what we need.

240
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,520
Make sure to grab the entire command even what's not shown without scrolling.

241
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,550
I'm going to fire that one off.

242
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,940
And once that's done we're actually going to mark that as executable using our seamount command.

243
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,650
Excuse me S.H. mad.

244
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,390
I never said some of this stuff out loud so sorry if there is an official pronunciation for that.

245
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,690
I don't come from the aboon do world.

246
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,310
But I did want to make an installation video showing you how to get everything set up.

247
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,560
So I'm going to run that over here marking the file as executable.

248
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,760
And then what are we going to do.

249
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,190
Well we're going to execute it.

250
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:04,500
So right here we can run Dakar compose with the version flag to make sure that it was installed successfully.

251
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
If you're seeing a version print then you're all done.

252
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,480
If you're seeing an error like docker compose command not found then something went wrong and once again

253
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,220
just crack open a question in the Q&amp;A.

254
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,250
So there we go.

255
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,850
We now have everything we need to actually continue on to the next video.

256
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,620
Keep in mind that when you're running on aboon do you are likely going to need to use sudo before all

257
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,070
of the darker and darker compose commands we run.

258
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,030
I'll remind you in the future but this is a quick reminder right now.

259
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,670
So we are all set up.

260
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,900
We have our database.

261
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:43,030
The database has our credentials and we connect to the database already using PGE admin.

262
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,620
The gooey.

263
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,600
We're going to use throughout this course.

264
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,390
Now aside from getting the database and installing and configuring PGE admin We also just installed

265
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,840
and configured docker which is going to allow us to run Prisma.

266
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,070
That's the topic of the next video.

267
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,900
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
