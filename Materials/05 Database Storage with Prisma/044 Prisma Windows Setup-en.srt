1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,760
In this video you're going to be setting up your machine to work with Prisma.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,150
Now as I mentioned in the last video there is a separate installation video for each operating system.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,970
This video is for my Windows users.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,030
If you're working on a Mac the last video was for you.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,720
If you're working on aboon to the next video is for you.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,890
So if you're still watching I am going to assume that you're on Windows and for the moment we're going

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,900
to stick with the Mac screen recording and a little bit later.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,880
In about three minutes we'll switch over to Windows when we have to perform some Windows specific things.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
All right my Windows users.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,110
Let's go ahead and set up our machines for Prisma.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,880
The first thing I'd like to do is get us set up with a database and the database we're going to be using

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,410
is post-grads.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:54,110
Grass is an S Q L database and it pairs really well with graft Well Eskew all databases in general pair

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,180
really well with graphics.

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,000
Well because with graphite you well you have to be explicit about the exact fields and type definitions

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,840
for those fields making it an easy match.

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,450
Later on in the course I will show you how to set up Prisma with Mongo D-B if that's your cup of tea.

18
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,460
Honestly any database you can pick works because in the end of the day Prisma abstracts that database

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,830
away anyways.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,400
For now though let's go ahead and grab a post gresse.

21
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,910
Heading over to Heroku dot com.

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,070
Now there are plenty of places where you can get a post gresse database and you do not have to use Heroku.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,790
I use Heroku because they have a free tier for what we're about to do.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,410
So you actually don't need to pay in order to get a basic database up and running for your sample application.

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,530
So take a moment to log in if you have an account and sign up.

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,960
If you don't I'm going to go ahead and log in to my existing account and once we're in we should see

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,230
a dashboard.

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,950
Now if you're creating your new account it's likely going to send you through some new customer flow

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,550
or it asks you to create an app and that's good because that's exactly what we're going to do.

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm going to create a new application and we're going to give it a name.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,490
I'm going to start with my last name and all lower case letters.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,840
No there's no spaces allowed.

33
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,520
So I will use hyphens to separate my words.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,940
That is Mead hyphen Prisma hyphen dev server.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,670
Awesome.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,510
Now we don't need to touch the region.

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,400
You likely have a default region.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,570
Good for your location around the world.

39
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,420
You could customize it to Europe if you wanted to but since I am in the US I'll stick with that and

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,980
I'm not going to touch the pipeline at all over going to do is create the application.

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,230
And once the application is created it's going to bring us to a set of steps describing how we can start

42
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,600
to deploy things.

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,110
Now there are plenty of features for Heroku but we're actually not going to need in this class.

44
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,890
We really only need a very small subset of them and we can get started by heading to the overview tab

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,520
for our application.

46
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,880
But we're concerned about is installing Add-Ons there's one for a postgresql database.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,100
So let's head over to the configure add ons page and from here we can search all of the available add

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,660
ons you want to search for Heroku post graphs.

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,040
Now there is a free tier for that.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,070
So once we click on Heroku postgresql it's going to allow us to pick the option we want everything from

51
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,890
free to $12000 a month.

52
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,320
Let's go ahead and start with that free plan.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,840
I am going to provision this which is going to create the database and once the database is created

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,390
We're going to be able to click that in our add ons list.

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,210
It's going to bring us over to the page where we can learn a little bit more about our database.

56
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,750
One important thing we need from here are the credentials.

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,050
The credentials that allow us to connect to the database you can find those over in these settings tab.

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,540
Right here we have the database credentials area and we can view our credentials.

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,190
And this is the information that we're going to need to connect to this newly created database from

60
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,650
the outside world.

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,800
Now we're over on my Windows machine and what we're going to do is install the next tool we need.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,250
This one is PGE admen and this is a post Gras database gooey.

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,700
It's a tool that's going to allow us to connect to our database and manage our data.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,610
So we'll be able to create data update data delete data and read all of our data in an Excel like table.

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,600
It's a fantastic companion.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,570
When working with post graphs so share our code is going to connect it to the database and it is going

67
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,500
to read and write to the database.

68
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,990
But it's also nice to have this gooey so we can track how our data is changing over time.

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,640
We can find this tool and install it by heading over to PGE admin dot org.

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,900
Here we can go to the downloads page and we can find the download for our operating system which is

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Windows and we can just grab the latest release.

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,440
You don't need to match up with my version.

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,370
You can grab the latest version available.

74
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,230
So I'm going to go ahead and download version three point two by grabbing the s e right here.

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,770
Now take some time to download the file so we don't have to watch and sit here while I download the

76
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,600
file I've actually downloaded it in advance.

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,220
I have the text file that would get downloaded right here.

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,230
And all we're going to do is install it.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,270
So if your file is downloaded we can run through the installer together.

80
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,790
Right here it's one of those click next installers so we don't have to do anything fancy.

81
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,770
We don't have to run any commands.

82
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,800
All we have to do is agree to their terms.

83
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,400
Pick a destination for our installation.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,500
We can go ahead and actually create a shortcut if we want to.

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,560
And then it just confirms our options and we run the installer.

86
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,480
Now once this is done we're going to run it PGE admen that is going to allow us to connect to our database.

87
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,720
So what we're going to do is provide these credentials to PGE admin so it can actually make this connection

88
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,830
securely.

89
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,890
From there we'll just make sure that the connection is all set up then we'll be done with PGE and then

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,820
for the moment and we'll continue to use it as we progress through the course in the background the

91
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,580
installer is almost done.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,270
I'm going to go ahead and cut the video to when the installer is complete.

93
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,300
Welcome back the installer is complete I'm going to go ahead and launch PGE admin for right here.

94
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,370
The tool is starting up and then the end of the day what's going to happen is that it is going to crack

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,270
open a browser tab.

96
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,500
And that's where we're going to interact with the tool itself.

97
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,130
All we're going to do is copy those credentials over so we can actually connect to the database.

98
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,670
So let's take a quick moment to let this tool start up.

99
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:37,590
Then we'll come back together right here we have our new tab for the admin application and now on the

100
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,540
left hand side we have a list of all of the servers that we've set up connections for and currently

101
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,280
you can see there are none.

102
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,110
So before we can actually do anything with this tool we have to go ahead and create a brand new server.

103
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,270
So right here we have to provide some details in the name field.

104
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,220
We're going to go ahead and pick a name for this.

105
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,070
It can be whatever you'd like.

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm going to use something like Heroku PGE as an example.

107
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,900
Then we have to move over to the connection tab.

108
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,780
And this is where we provide all of the connection details we have over inside of our Heroku dashboard.

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,130
The first thing I'm going to do is grab the host value copying that to the clipboard and bringing it

110
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,780
over to PGE admin.

111
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
We're at a pace that in right here.

112
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,870
Next up is the port that is the value 5 4 3 2.

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,420
That's the default post gresse port and you can see it's used over here as well.

114
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,800
So there's no need to change anything.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Next up we have our database itself Amen copy this to the clipboard.

116
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,550
Then over here I'm going to paste that in under maintenance database.

117
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,820
After that we have the username and password.

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,530
We have both of those over here.

119
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,060
I'm going to grab the user I'm going to bring that over and paste it in.

120
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,450
And I'm also going to grab the password.

121
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,510
So let's take a moment to grab that password.

122
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:03,170
Copy it to the clipboard paste it in and I'm going to choose to check the save password button so I

123
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,110
don't have to re-enter the password every single time I want to connect.

124
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,340
Now we're actually done.

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,000
We can go ahead and save this connection and it's going to test the connection and right over here we

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,630
can now actually expand that server.

127
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,010
We can view our database by expanding databases.

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,710
And the first thing you'll notice is that there is way more than just our database.

129
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,410
There are actually maybe a couple of thousand different databases running on this server.

130
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,080
Now that doesn't mean we can actually access them.

131
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,310
If I were to try to expand one of these other databases with a little red mark what do I get.

132
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,790
I get an error saying that I do not have permission to connect to that database.

133
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,250
And that's a good thing.

134
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,140
Now we have a really long list of databases here.

135
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,710
It can be a burden to scroll through and find yours.

136
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,480
So what I like to do is just copy the database name to the clipboard.

137
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,850
Then use control after bring up my search on page I paste that database value in and it shows it right

138
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,340
here.

139
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:09,240
Here we can see this database shown in gold is something we can connect to and if I expand it we're

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,810
going to be able to dive in to exactly what that database contains.

141
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,230
Now this is actually where we're going to stop with P.G. and then for the moment once we actually get

142
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,770
Prisma set up we'll dive into here and explore our data.

143
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,470
But for now there's actually nothing in here worth looking at though we do have PGE admin set up and

144
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,920
connecting to the database which is a fantastic first step.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,040
There is just one more thing we have to grab before we're done with this video.

146
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,370
And that is a tool called docker.

147
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:47,740
We can find that by cracking open a new tab and heading over to Dr. dot com if you've never used or

148
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,340
worked with Daker before that's perfectly fine.

149
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,890
We're going to be using a very small amount of Dakar in this class.

150
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,740
DAKAR can be a complex tool in the whole debt ops space and there are literally entire You Tommy courses

151
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,440
that just cover Dharker.

152
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,350
We don't need to worry about all of that.

153
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,860
We're using a very very small subset of its features.

154
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,680
Now what is Dakar.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,860
Well it's part of this whole containerisation and virtual machine movement.

156
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,930
So if I'm building up an application I have my application code and I have my dependencies.

157
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,710
Let's say I need to run on Linux.

158
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,660
And I also need get a. node Yes and stop.

159
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,670
Now I have a couple of options I could choose to allow people who want to run the application to actually

160
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,720
install all of those things that I could cross my fingers and hope it works on their environment.

161
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,860
Or I can bundle it all up into a container the container which in essence is a little virtual machine

162
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,840
can then be executed from anywhere docker is supported and the good news is that docker is supported

163
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,600
pretty much everywhere whether it's Mac Linux or Windows.

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,830
You can run Doctor containers regardless of what tools or dependencies they need.

165
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,620
You don't have to slow down and install a whole bunch of stuff on your machine.

166
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,230
For every application instead you just run the container.

167
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,560
It's very easy to stop containers to delete them and to free up all of that space without trying to

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,930
remember all of the dependencies you had to install.

169
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,340
It's just a better way to manage apps.

170
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,240
Now there are two sides to docker.

171
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,400
There is the person creating the application and creating the container and there's the person who's

172
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,750
using the container to run the application.

173
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,320
That's the side we're on.

174
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,070
So we're not going to learn about the ins and outs of docker because in reality we're just a user of

175
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,920
docker trying to run a container provided by somebody else.

176
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,160
Let's go ahead and download and install this tool we can find it by heading over to the get started

177
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,670
button.

178
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,030
If that button has been moved for some reason you can just go to Dr dot com forward slash and get started.

179
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,680
And if I scroll down under the developer tab we have our download for Windows button.

180
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,480
Now there are a few different versions of docker for Windows we want the docker toolbox.

181
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,850
There's a link to that right over here on the right hand side.

182
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,420
The docker tool box is going to allow us to do exactly what we want to do which is use it as the dependency

183
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,520
for Prisma.

184
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,580
Perfect.

185
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,900
Now we do have to go ahead and actually download and install this.

186
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,040
So let's go ahead and do just that.

187
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,760
If I scroll down on this page we can grab the Windows installation.

188
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,040
This is going to download an XP and to save us all a bunch of time.

189
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,520
I've downloaded this ahead of time so take a moment to allow that download to finish then come back

190
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,110
and click play and we'll go through the installation process all right at this point.

191
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,820
I am going to assume you have a docker tool box downloaded.

192
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,920
All we need to do is give that a double click to start the installation process much like we saw with

193
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,240
PGE admin.

194
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,920
This is going to be one of those click next type installers.

195
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,860
We need to pick the location to install the tool we want to leave all of the options at their default.

196
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,410
So here we are installing everything which is good.

197
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,510
Then from there we're going to leave the next pages options as default as well.

198
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,130
Finally it's going to ask us to confirm everything which we will.

199
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,590
And now it's going to run through the installation process once Dharker is actually installed to wrap

200
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,330
up the video.

201
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,740
We're just going to run it and make sure that it's running correctly.

202
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,800
As long as it's running correctly then we'll be able to be done with this video and continue on to the

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,550
next one.

204
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,210
Actually setting up and using Prisma from here I just have to confirm that I want to install everything

205
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,110
and that should wrap up the installation process right here.

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,930
It's all done.

207
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,640
Perfect.

208
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,650
Let's go ahead and click Finish.

209
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,730
That is going to wrap up the installation.

210
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,500
And we're going to go ahead and actually start up Dr Mary.

211
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
Here we can see we have a couple of options.

212
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,020
We want to double click.

213
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,120
Dr. QuickStart terminal this is going to crack open a terminal style window and it is going to start

214
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
up the docker application.

215
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,540
And this is something that we're going to leave running in the background for as long as we're using

216
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,180
docker.

217
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,570
Now if you restart your machine you can always just start up the docker QuickStart terminal again to

218
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,790
get darker up and running once again.

219
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,200
But once again it is important to leave this window running.

220
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:17,720
As we progress through the course now on initial booting it's going to take about 30 seconds for it

221
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,290
to go through the process.

222
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:25,550
And once the process is complete you'll know because it's going to show you a big message in green.

223
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,560
So we're just going to wait here for a couple of moments clicking yes to confirm that we do actually

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,170
want to set up Daker the way that doctor wants to set itself up.

225
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,220
And once this is done we'll be done.

226
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,790
All right.

227
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,410
Here we are.

228
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,070
This is what we are looking for.

229
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,770
This is the screen that lets us know that docker started up successfully and right here it's showing

230
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,480
us the local IP address where docker can be used.

231
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,460
It's important to keep the screen up and make note of this address because you as Windows users are

232
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,270
going to need to use this a bit later on.

233
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,830
So that's it for this video.

234
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,210
We have three things set up.

235
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,030
We created a brand new post database using Heroku.

236
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,600
That's where all of our data is going to be stored for our local development app as well as our real

237
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,720
world production application.

238
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,600
We also installed PGE admen which is going to allow us to interact with our database from a gooey.

239
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,090
And finally we installed docker which is what's going to let us run the Prisma application.

240
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,810
All right.

241
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,090
That is it for the Windows specific installation video.

242
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,100
The next video is for our Linux users so you can go ahead and skip that video and jump right back in

243
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,410
to the rest of the course.

244
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,230
I'll see you there.
