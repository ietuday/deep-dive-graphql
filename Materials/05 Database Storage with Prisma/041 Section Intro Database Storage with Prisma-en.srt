Welcome to Section 5 and to the start of part two and part one we looked at the basics of graft.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,320
Well all of the fundamentals you learned about things like this schema and our three operations the

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,090
query the mutation and the subscription.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,420
In this part part two we're going to start to focus on all of the features you would expect in a real

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,020
application things like database storage authentication testing and deployment.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,450
Now that's all part two in this section in particular we're going to focus on data storage using a very

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,870
exciting tool called Prisma Prisma is kind of like an alarm but it comes with a ton of great features

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,860
specific to graft well making it really easy to integrate into your application.

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,860
And the next video we're going to talk about exactly what Prisma is then we'll set it up throughout

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:57,860
the section getting our data stored in a database as opposed to accessing it from that D-B dot G-S file.

11
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,260
All right let's go ahead and jump right in.
