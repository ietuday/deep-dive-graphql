1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,230
In this video you're going to start to set up your local machine to work with Prisma.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,670
There are a few tools we're going to be installing and configuring to get everything up and running

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,620
and then we'll actually be able to learn how this tool works with our graphs.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,280
Well application.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,410
Now the catch here is that the process for installing and setting all of this up is a little different

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,980
for each operating system.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,240
So I've actually created three separate installation videos.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,780
This video shows you how to set everything up for Mac.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,680
The next video shows you how to set up everything for Windows and the video after that shows you how

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,010
to set everything up for a aboon do you do not need to watch all three just pick the installation video

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,610
for the operating system you're currently working on.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,210
All right.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,070
If you're still watching this video I am going to assume you're using a Mac.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,350
So let's go ahead and get things set up.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,080
The first thing I'd like to do is get us set up with a database and the database we're going to be using

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,280
is post-grads post-crash is an S Q L database and it pairs really well with graft Well Eskew all databases

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,320
in general pair really well with graphics.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,200
Well because with graft you well you have to be explicit about the exact fields and type definitions

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,920
for those fields making it an easy match later on in the course I will show you how to set up Prisma

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,660
with Mongo D-B if that's your cup of tea.

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,660
Honestly any database you can pick works because in the end of the day Prisma abstracts that database

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,030
away anyways.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,600
For now though let's go ahead and grab a post gresse.

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,050
Heading over to Heroku dot com.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,150
And there are plenty of places where you can get a post gresse database and you do not have to use Heroku.

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,990
I use Heroku because they have a free tier for what we're about to do.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,610
So you actually don't need to pay in order to get a basic database up and running for your sample application.

28
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,730
So take a moment to log in if you have an account and sign up.

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,160
If you don't I'm going to go ahead and log in to my existing account and once we're in we should see

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,430
a dashboard.

31
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,150
Now if you're creating your new account it's likely going to send you through some new customer flow

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,500
or it asks you to create an app and that's good because that's exactly what we're going to do.

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,720
I'm going to create a new application and we're going to give it a name.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm going to start with my last name and all lower case letters.

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,040
Now there's no spaces allowed.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,590
So I will use hyphens to separate my words.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,140
That is Mead hyphen Prisma hyphen dev server.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,110
Awesome.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,710
Now we don't need to touch the region.

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,600
You likely have a default region.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,770
Good for your location around the world.

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,620
You could customize it to Europe if you wanted to but since I am in the US I'll stick with that and

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,180
I'm not going to touch the pipeline at all over going to do is create the application.

44
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,430
And once the application is created it's going to bring us to a set of steps describing how we can start

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,800
to deploy things.

46
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,310
Now there are plenty of features for Heroku but we're actually not going to need in this class.

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,090
We really only need a very small subset of them and we can get started by heading to the overview tab

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,730
for our application.

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,110
But we're concerned about is installing Add-Ons there's one for a postgresql database.

50
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,300
So let's head over to the configure add ons page and from here we can search all of the available add

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,860
ons you want to search for Heroku post graphs.

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,240
Now there is a free tier for that.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,240
So once we click on Heroku postgresql it's going to allow us to pick the option we want everything from

54
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,050
free to $12000 a month.

55
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's go ahead and start with that free plan.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,040
I am going to provision this which is going to create the database and once the database is created

57
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,590
We're going to be able to click that in our add ons list.

58
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,250
It's going to bring us over to the page where we can learn a little bit more about our database.

59
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,950
One important thing we need from here are the credentials.

60
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,060
The credentials that allow us to connect to the database.

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,240
You can find those over in these settings tab.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,740
Right here we have the database credentials area and we can view our credentials.

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,390
And this is the information that we're going to need to connect to this newly created database from

64
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,860
the outside world.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,110
Now with your seeing credentials for your database you're all done with Heroku.

66
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,250
We're not going to be using any other features of it.

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,190
We're just here for the database and if we have our credentials then we're all set.

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,500
The database is created and we can now connect to it.

69
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,550
The next tool that we're going to install is called PGE admin and that's going to allow us to manage

70
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,210
our postgresql database via a GUI.

71
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,350
So we're going to be able to view our data making changes to it like it was in an Excel file without

72
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,390
needing to use code to interact with the database.

73
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,480
Of course our code is going to interact with the database but it is nice to see what data you're working

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,040
with and how data is changing over time.

75
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,960
You can find the gooey that we're going to be using by googling PGE admin B-G admin is probably the

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,870
most popular one out there.

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,480
It might not be the sleekest looking tool but it does get the job done.

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,670
It's super stable.

79
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,730
If you head over to PGE admin dot org we can download the version necessary for us for Mac users.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,170
Now D.G. admin is available for pretty much everything out there which is why it's a great choice.

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,180
We're going to grab the Mac specific one right here just grabbing whatever the latest version is.

82
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,790
You don't need to match up your version with my version.

83
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,570
It's perfectly fine to just use the latest stable release.

84
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,030
Right here we have the DMG file that is what we need.

85
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,000
When I click that and it is going to start the installation down below perfect.

86
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Now the installer for PGE admin is one of those click next installer.

87
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,780
You don't have to do anything fancy.

88
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,750
You're not running any commands from the command prompt.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,350
All you're doing is cracking it open clicking next and giving permission for it to install something

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,600
on your machine.

91
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,070
Now I already have PGE admin installed so all you need to do is wait for the download to complete and

92
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,550
run through the installation and then once it's installed.

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,470
Go ahead and crack it open.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,540
You should be able to find it in your Applications folder.

95
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:59,540
So I have my finder right here if I head over to applications and go down to the right here I have P.G.

96
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,880
admin for all I'm going to do is click that it is going to start up P.G. admin.

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,690
And in the end of the day what it's going to do is open up a new browser tab.

98
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,960
So take some time to pause the video until you've got everything installed when you're seeing the PGE

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,750
admin tab in your browser like I'm seeing here.

100
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,160
You can go ahead and comeback and follow along.

101
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,780
All right.

102
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm going to assume at this point you are seeing what I'm seeing.

103
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,570
We're going to do is add a new server.

104
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,670
This is going to allow us to set up the connection to the database that we just created.

105
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:37,010
And I'm going to match up the name here with the name I picked for my Heroku app that was Mead hyphen

106
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,580
Prisma hyphen dev hyphen server.

107
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,860
It does not need to match up just matching it up because that's logical.

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,350
It's going to make it easy to find this server.

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,220
From here we have to move over to the connection tab.

110
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,650
And this is where we put in all of the connection details that Heroku spit out.

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,210
We're going to start with the host.

112
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,020
You can find the host right here.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,180
We have to copy that value and paste it over.

114
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,640
Then after that what do we have.

115
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Well we have our database.

116
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,680
This is the actual database that's been given to us.

117
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,620
So I'm going to grab that and bring that over as well right here to the maintenance database tab.

118
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,540
Then we have a user and password we have to grab both of those as well.

119
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,850
We have user right here.

120
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm going to paste that in the User Name field and then down below we have password.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,700
The last field we need we can bring that over as well.

122
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,140
And I am going to check that save password checkbox.

123
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,250
I don't want to have to enter the password every single time I want to connect from P.G. adamant.

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,530
Now what we can actually save the connection from here we should be able to expand the new connection

125
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,720
we've just created and go under databases.

126
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,410
Now this is where things get a little bit tricky.

127
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,340
What you see here is every single database on this shared cluster.

128
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,590
So it's not just yours now just because I can see them all listed doesn't mean I can actually access

129
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,790
them if I try to expand one of these databases you can see I get an error saying permission denied.

130
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,210
So there are a lot of databases listed here but in reality only one of them is the database we can actually

131
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,190
use out of what 2000 databases to easily find it.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,410
All I do is I just grab the database name over here copy it to the clipboard use find on page in the

133
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,050
browser to search for that database by name.

134
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,990
And here it is.

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,720
And you can see that this one does not have that little X next to it.

136
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,140
That's because this is a database.

137
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,540
We can actually connect to if I expand it.

138
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,190
You can see we have a few different options under here.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,270
And for the moment we're actually going to ignore all of these.

140
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,030
We'll talk a bit more about why P.G. admen is a useful tool.

141
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,150
Once we get Prisma set up and we are actually working with some data.

142
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,780
So for now we have our Heroku database set up and we have a way to connect to it from a gooey.

143
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,160
This is a great first step.

144
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,110
The next thing we're going to do before we actually install Prisma is to go ahead and install a tool

145
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,640
called docker so we can find this by heading over to Dr. dot com.

146
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,150
This is a dependency it's something that we have to have installed on our machines in order to use Prisma.

147
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,740
If you've never used or worked with Daker before that's perfectly fine.

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,720
We're going to be using a very small amount of Dakar in this class Daker can be a complex tool in the

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,240
whole dev ops space and there are literally entire You Tommy courses that just cover Dharker we don't

150
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,750
need to worry about all of that.

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,260
We're using a very very small subset of its features.

152
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,080
Now what is Dakar.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,050
Well it's part of this whole containerisation and virtual machine movement.

154
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,930
So if I'm building up an application I have my application code and I have my dependencies.

155
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,690
Let's say I need to run on Linux.

156
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,490
And I also need get and node.

157
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,670
Yes and stop.

158
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,650
Now I have a couple of options I could choose to allow people who want to run the application to actually

159
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,230
install all of those things then I could cross my fingers and hope it works on their environment or

160
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,780
I can bundle it all up into a container.

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,090
The container which in essence is a little virtual machine can then be executed from anywhere Dharker

162
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,780
is supported.

163
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,550
And the good news is that docker is supported pretty much everywhere whether it's Mac Linux or Windows.

164
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,820
You can run docker containers regardless of what tools or dependencies they need.

165
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,570
You don't have to slow down and install a whole bunch of stuff on your machine.

166
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,180
For every application instead you just run the container.

167
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,540
It's very easy to stop containers to delete them and to free up all of that space without trying to

168
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,910
remember all of the dependencies you had to install.

169
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,300
It's just a better way to manage apps.

170
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,170
Now there are two sides to docker.

171
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,380
There is the person creating the application and creating the container and there's the person who's

172
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,710
using the container to run the application.

173
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,250
That's the side we're on.

174
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,030
So we're not going to learn about the ins and outs of docker because in reality we're just a user of

175
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,060
a docker trying to run a container provided by somebody else.

176
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,770
Now we're here just to install it.

177
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:58,680
We can find the installation stuff over at Docker dot com forward slash get hyphen docker and there

178
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240
are versions available for all operating systems.

179
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,130
We're going to be using the free community edition.

180
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,750
We do have to head over to what's called the docker store.

181
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,850
Don't worry you don't actually check out or buy anything.

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,470
It's totally free.

183
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,730
Right here we have versions for all operating systems and set ups.

184
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,440
We're going to be using the version for Mac and once we're here you are going to have to log in.

185
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,940
So you're not going to see the get darker button you're going to see a button saying you need to lock

186
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,440
in what you have to do is create an account and then verify your email.

187
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,840
That'll bring you back to this page and you'll actually be able to click get docker to download the

188
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,830
tool.

189
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,180
Now once that tool is downloaded it's one of those click next installer's.

190
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,200
So take some time to actually go through the process of installing Dharker.

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,700
Obviously you have to wait for it to finish downloading and then when you have it installed you can

192
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,670
come back and click play.

193
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,250
All right.

194
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,480
At this point in going to assume that you have docker installed once you have it installed all you have

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,820
to do is open it up in your finder.

196
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,270
So I'm going to go over to my applications folder.

197
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,650
I'm going to go down to D.

198
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,300
I have Dharker sitting right here and I'm going to double click it.

199
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,570
Now when we click Dakar and we actually open it up we're not going to see anything visually on our machine

200
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,510
though it did indeed start the docker process.

201
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,400
You should be able to view that up in your menu bar.

202
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,790
You should see this little half well with the little containers on it and if you actually click that

203
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,760
you can get the status of docker.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,240
Now the first time you start it it's going to say something like Dharker is starting up with a little

205
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,320
orange icon right here.

206
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,780
It will take anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute to actually get it started up.

207
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,570
You just want to wait until you see Dharker is running.

208
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,030
If you're seeing docker is running then you're all done with this video.

209
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,090
You have a post database you have PGE admins set up and you have docker up and running which means that

210
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,260
you have everything installed necessary to use Prisma.

211
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,920
Now remember the next two videos are installation videos for my windows and for my Linux users you can

212
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,620
skip both of those and move on to the video after those that were actually going to start the process

213
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,290
of installing and running.

214
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,910
Our very first Prisma application.

215
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,870
I am beyond excited to get to it.

216
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,860
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
