1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,320
Before we wrap up this section and died anti-graft Well there are two things we're going to have to

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,300
have installed on our computers.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,960
The first is node SJS which you can find out.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,300
No.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,000
J.S. not org since knowing node is a pre-req for this class Hopefully you already have it installed

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,860
on your computer.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,840
If you don't have node installed or you're using a much older version just go ahead and grab a V8 of

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,090
node or higher you can grab the installer run through it by clicking next a bunch of times and then

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,920
you'll be all done the exact version of node you use with this class.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,050
Does not matter.

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,030
All of the graphics.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,610
Well functionality that we're going to be exploring comes from specific NPM modules which we'll be installing

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,230
later.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,510
We just need a semi-modern version of node to get the environment up and running the 8 of node or greater

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,400
is going to work perfectly fine.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,000
So v 8 9 10 or whatever else comes out in the future so run through that installer.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,880
Make sure you have node installed and if you do we can move on to the second tool which is going to

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,110
be a text editor.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,240
As always you are more than welcome to use whatever text editor you're comfortable with if you're interested

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,580
in following along and setting up your environment just like mine.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,050
I'm going to be using Visual Studio code.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,320
You can find that over at Code dot Visual Studio dot com if you haven't used it before I recommend giving

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,920
it a shot.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,660
It's a fantastic editor that integrates really well with all sorts of environments including graphs.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,810
Well Visual Studio code is free.

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,840
It's open source and it's available for all operating systems.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,100
So if you do want to use it go ahead and grab the installer and get it installed.

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,610
We're going to wrap up this video by going over the plugins.

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,840
I'll be using for VSC in this class.

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,450
Now some of these plug ins will have replacements in other editors but I can't guarantee that.

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,140
So here's the plug in list I'm using for Visual Studio code.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,150
I got about half a dozen or so that really come in handy.

33
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,960
The first one Babel six slash iOS 7 just gives us support for all of those modern features like Aero

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,120
functions and async await the next plugin beautify allows us to format our code on the fly.

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,120
After that we have Dharker which is going to come in handy later in the course when we worry about deploying

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,570
our applications.

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,870
After that I have duplicate action.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,180
This is a simple one that allows me to write click files or folders to duplicate them inside of the

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,570
file tree.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,220
After that I have graphed well for Visual Studio code.

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,580
I definitely recommend installing this one as it's going to give us syntax highlighting for the graphics

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,380
you l code that we're going to be writing very soon after that.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,610
I have NPM NPM Intellisense which just give me better support when working with NPM modules something

44
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,100
we will be doing in this class.

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,920
Then I have Sublime Text key map I use that because I really fell in love with the Sublime Text keyboard

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,810
shortcuts.

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,740
I had a really hard time switching to some of the Visual Studio code defaults.

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,270
This one like all of these is completely optional but if you do like the Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,420
it's a great tool.

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
Last up word count.

51
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,650
Just count the words in a markdown file.

52
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,020
Nothing fancy there.

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,410
So these are all the plug ins.

54
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,660
I'll be using throughout the class if you have node installed and a text editor installed you are ready

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,840
to dive into the next section where we're actually going to start learning about graft.

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,210
Well I am super excited to get to it.

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,820
So stay tuned and I will see you then.
