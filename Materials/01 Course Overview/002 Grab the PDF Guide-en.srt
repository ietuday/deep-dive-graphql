1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,370
This course it contains a lot of new information.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,910
So to make that information easier to digest and remember I've included a PTF companion with the class

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,510
this PTF guide can be downloaded as part of the lecture resources for this lesson and they recommend

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,730
taking just a quick moment to download it.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,970
Crack it open and see what it's all about the guide itself contains lecture notes as well as documentation

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,050
links and code samples for everything we talk about in the class.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,240
It's a much more scanning or friendly version of the Course that's not meant to be read front to back

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,120
like a book.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,200
It's meant to be your companion as you move through the class.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,720
So if you forget where I said something or exactly what we talked about the PTF guide can get you that

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,390
information quickly and easily.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,010
All right that's it for this one.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,510
Let's go ahead and talk about why we should ever use graphs.

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:52,870
Well.
