1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,810
Welcome to the class.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,140
Thanks so much for joining in Andrew and together.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:14,260
We're going to explore what graft well is why it's useful and how we can use it to build better applications.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,530
Now we'll get into all of that shortly.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,480
I just want to take a moment in this one to talk about a couple of important things.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,030
We're going to talk about how we'll be spending our time together so I'll break down what we're going

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,180
to cover in each part of the course.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,620
And I'm also going to offer up a few tips and suggestions for getting the most out of a class

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,800
the course itself is broken up into two major parts.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,080
In part one we're going to focus on learning the fundamentals of graft well and figuring out how we

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,630
can integrate it into Noad.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,790
Jay ass so here we'll be focusing on the core building blocks those built in features learning how we

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,780
can build our own Grath applications from scratch.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,830
Now that's part one and we'll be starting that in just a couple of videos in part two later in the class.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,480
We'll transition into integrating what we learn about graft Well in part one with all of those real

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:14,080
features we'd expect from applications things like authentication database storage production deployments

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,660
automatic test suites and more.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,160
By the end Yula the real application.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,350
So part one.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,660
Those building blocks part to integrating the building blocks to create a real world app.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,360
All right let's go ahead and talk about a couple of tips and tricks for getting the most out of the

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,190
class.

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,300
This course was designed to be completely interactive.

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,310
So as you move through the videos I'm going to be typing code on the screen.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,230
It's important that you have your text editor open and that you're typing that code out as well.

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,410
As we progressed through the videos we're going to end up building on our existing application and you

27
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,980
want to make sure you have all of the same features that I have.

28
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,190
Now this is sort of a monkey see monkey do situation.

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,160
That's great for when you're first exposed to a topic but it's not so great for retaining it or for

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,620
figuring out how to use it to solve problems on your own.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,370
That's why throughout the class I have about 85 separate challenges.

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,480
These are little points in the video we're going to ask you to pause the video.

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Solve a problem based off of what you learned then you can come back and watch me work through the solution.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,600
It is essential that you follow through with both of these.

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,010
So if I write code you should be writing code and when there's time for a challenge break you should

36
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,540
actually take some time could try to solve the problem on your own.

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,230
That's going to make sure that when you're done the class you can actually use what you've learned here

38
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,940
to solve problems and build applications which is my goal for you.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,140
All right let's take a quick moment to talk about getting help if you need it.

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,750
The last thing I want to talk about is how to get help if you get stuck.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,260
So as you're moving through the course maybe your project fails.

42
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,280
In the video you can see my project working but when you run the project on your machine you get a cryptic

43
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,650
error message.

44
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,960
Or maybe you just need clarification on why we're using one technique and not something else.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,670
Regardless of what your question is you can always ask a brand new question in the course of Q&amp;A to

46
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,660
get help.

47
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,960
When you do be sure to include as many details as possible as those go a long way towards us being able

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,380
to help you faster.

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,670
Things like screen shot code samples and error messages are going to allow us to track down and fix

50
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,320
the issue quickly.

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,380
Now there are two other ways you can get help even faster.

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,680
One is to browse the Q&amp;A for similar questions.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,720
So we get dozens of questions every single day and they all have answers.

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,830
There might be a question similar to yours so you can get help in a matter of seconds as opposed to

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,710
having to wait a little bit for one of us to respond.

56
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,830
Last up if you're running into a problem and you suspect it's code related I do include the lecture

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,740
code as the zip download for each and every lecture here on you to me so you can always download the

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,460
code I wrote in the video.

59
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,010
You can then compare my code to yours and likely find the problem if not.

60
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,350
As always feel free to ask a question in the course.

61
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,060
Want.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,780
All right.

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,990
That is it for this little welcome video.

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,890
Let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
